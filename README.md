# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

Welcome to my **EDA Projects Repository**!  
This repo contains **data exploration, visualization, and insights** from multiple datasets using Python.  
The goal is to understand the data better, identify patterns, handle missing values, and prepare it for machine learning models.

## 📂 Datasets Included

### 1. 🏠 House Price Dataset
- **Objective:** Analyze factors affecting house prices
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning & handling missing values
  - Correlation analysis between features (e.g., size, location, year built)
  - Price distribution & outlier detection
  - Visualization using heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms
- **Insights:**
  - Location and square footage are the top predictors of price

### 2. 🍽️ Zomato Dataset
- **Objective:** Analyze restaurant trends, ratings, and cuisines
- **Key Steps:**
  - Cleaning inconsistent categorical data (e.g., cuisine names)
  - Visualizing restaurant ratings distribution
  - Analyzing cost for two across locations
  - Identifying popular cuisines and cities
- **Insights:**
  - Top-rated restaurants are concentrated in urban centers with moderate pricing

---

### 3. 📰 Black Paper Dataset
- **Objective:** Explore patterns and textual analysis from the dataset
- **Key Steps:**
  - Preprocessing text data
  - Frequency analysis of keywords
  - Topic modeling to identify main themes
- **Insights:**
  - Certain recurring terms dominate across documents, indicating key focus areas

---

### 4. ✈️ Flight Dataset
- **Objective:** Analyze flight delays, cancellations, and patterns
- **Key Steps:**
  - Analyzing seasonal and monthly trends
  - Identifying peak travel times
  - Delay reasons and airline comparisons
  - Visualization using bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps
- **Insights:**
  - Weather-related delays spike in winter months; certain carriers have higher on-time performance
